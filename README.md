2. Admin Features

    Admin Identification: Maintain a list of admin user IDs in Cloudflare KV.

    Edit Messages and Files: Use Telegram's editMessageText, editMessageCaption, and editMessageMedia methods to allow admins to edit messages and files.

3. Client Registration

    User Account Creation: Implement a registration process where clients create an account with a username and password.

    Store User Data: Use Cloudflare KV to store user data securely. Consider hashing passwords before storing them.

4. Client Interaction

    Upload Files: Allow clients to upload files (e.g., resume, portfolio) which can be stored in a Telegram channel or another storage solution.

    Generate Resume Link: Generate a unique link for each client's resume/portfolio. This link can be shared with others.

5. Portfolio and Resume Generation

    Portfolio Link: When a non-user clicks on the resume link, display a menu with options to view the portfolio and answer questions.

    Base Portfolio Message: The first message should contain the user's image, name, description, summary, and other relevant data fetched from Cloudflare KV.

    Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implement NLP to understand and respond to user queries more effectively.

9. Security Considerations

    Data Encryption: Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is stored securely.

    Authentication: Implement proper authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

10. Testing and Deployment
